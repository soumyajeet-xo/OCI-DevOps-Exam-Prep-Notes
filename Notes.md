- 12-factor app principles aid the development of service-oriented applications.
- Created by Heroku developers in 2011, aligns well with microservices.
- Each principle contributes to the agility and effectiveness of microservices.

## Key Principles of 12-Factor App Methodology:

### Codebase:

- Each app should have a single code repository without sharing with another.
- Independent codebases for microservices ease CI/CD processes.

### Dependencies:

- Manage application packages for non contenarized app using package managers like SBT, Maven, or Gradle.
- Configuration management tools like Docker files for containerized environments respectively.

### Configuration:

- Externalize configuration from the code.
- Store configuration data separately from the code as variables.
- Facilitates easy updates without code changes or redeployment.

### Backing Services:

- Apps can switch providers without code modifications.
- Changing a database server can be managed through configuration changes.

### Build, Release, and Run:

- Separate build and run stages; use CI/CD tools.
- Docker images simplify separation of build, release, and run phases.

### Processes:

- Embrace statelessness; enables horizontal scaling.
- If state maintenance required, use resources like Redis or Memcached.

### Port Binding:

- Applications self-contained; not deployed on external web servers.
- Promotes access to persistent data through service APIs, avoiding implicit service contracts.

### Concurrency:

- Opt for horizontal scaling over vertical scaling.
- Containers and microservices allow efficient horizontal scaling.

### Disposability:

- Enable system to handle addition/removal of instances.
- Containers allow instant stopping and starting of instances.

### Development and Production Parity:

- Maintain development, staging, and production environments similarly.
- Containers maintain consistent execution environments.

### Logs:

- Logs crucial for troubleshooting and understanding user behavior.
- Stream logs to chosen location for better visibility.

### Admin Processes:

- Separate administrative tasks from the app to prevent disruptions.
- Eases one-time tasks like data cleanup or feature toggling.

## Benefits of Microservices:

- Loosely-coupled components for individual development, replacement, and scaling.
- Focus on business capabilities for enhanced user experience.
- Multilingual programming language choice.
- Parallel development teams increase productivity and deployment speed.

## Drawbacks of Microservices Design:

- Increased complexity due to multiple services.
- Complex communication between services.
- Hosting infrastructure and skilled teams needed, making it costlier.
- Requires a mature agile and DevOps culture.
- Debugging challenges due to distributed nature.
- Global testing difficulties due to distributed components.

## Conclusion:
